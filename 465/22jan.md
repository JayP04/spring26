## Networking technology
- NIC = network interface controller
- MAC (media access contorl) address = unique identifier 
    - first three segment identifies manufacturer
    - rest are unique per user
- IP Addess - protocols addresses that are numerical labels assigned to each device which is involved with the devices that are within the interent protocol for communication.
    - two principal functions: 
        - host and network interface identification
        - location addressing
- Versions of IP
    - IPv4 - 32 bit address
    - IPv6 - 128 bit address
- MAC vs IP
    - IP is software level address that can be changed
        - if there are two different IP for same device, then it will be identified by MAC address
        - differnet IP addresse for different networks
    - MAC is hardware level address that is fixed
- Computer Ports : can be either physical or virtual connection points
    - physical - USB, HDMI
    - virtual - software based, to share hardware resources without interference
        - ex: TCP/UDP ports
